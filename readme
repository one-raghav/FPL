DB: mongodb
ODM ( object data model) : mongoosejs

This App is a base framework to create REST apis for any mongo collections with protected CRUD apis.
A token based authentication is used to limit the access to the create/update/delete apis.


get started :

to add a new model: - A model is a DB collection mapping to JS object, provided by mongoosejs
	1. add a mongoose schema json in "root/models/". eg: game.json
	2. register the schema in "root/models/models.js". 

to add a new handler for the models: - A handler is a set of business logic performed on a given models.
	1. add the js file containing set of handler functions in "root/handlers" . eg. games.js
	2. extend your handler from "root/handlers/BaseHandler.js" to get all the CRUD operations impleneted implicitly.

to add a new set of routes:
	1. register api enpoints, http methods and handling functions and objects, in "root/routes/configs"
		eg: games.js
	2. register the config in "root/routes/index.js"


Done, you can access your registered APIs.

to start the application:

configure the mongodb in dbConig.json

$npm install
$npm start

you will get the server started at 3000 port by default
